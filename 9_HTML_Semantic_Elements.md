## Semantic elements = elements with a meaning. <br><br>

# What are Semantic Elements?

Older web sites conisted HTML tags like: `<div id="nav">` `<div class="header">` `<div id="footer">` to indicate navigation, header, and footer but they told nothing about the nature of its content to search engines.

A semantic element/tag clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Semantic tags are used to give proper meaning to the websites and help the search engines to analyze the website properly. 

Good use of Semantics in a website, improves the SEO ranking of the website.

Examples of **non-semantic** elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of **semantic** elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.

But now the question arises, is it necessary to use semantic tags? The straight answer is **No**. It is **not necessary** to use the semantics but including it will help with the SEO part and improve the ranking of your website. If you are working on a blog, then you must use this technique to improve its ranking.
