IDE/Code Editor: Visual Studio Code. It is a free open source IDE from Microsoft which makes 
***************  our work a lot easier. I recommend everyone to download this software and install it.
                 The software works the same in macOS and Linux as well. 

Live Server: An important VS Code extension for rendering .html files in our web browser.
************           
            To render your webpage using live server
             -  open your .html file that you want to render - in VS Code 
             -  right click on some empty space inside the file and select "Open with Live Server Option".
             -  This will open the "rendered version" of your .html file in the default web browser of your system.

Web Browser: You can use any web browser of your choice for rendering HTML files. I use Microsoft Edge browser.

<!-- Syntax for Commenting in HTML file. -->

<!-- Comments are completely ignored by the browser and 
are treated as those parts in the code which the developer writes for his understanding. -->

<!-- Keyboard shortcut for Commenting -- ` ctrl + /? ` : Works well for all programming Languages in VS Code.  
    Press ` ctrl + /? ` again to uncomment any line. -->

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
- HTML is a standard markup language : used for making the basic skeleton of a website/webpage. Without it, no website can run.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language : used to handle the presentation & styling of a web page. It makes the website look attractive and beautiful. 
- JavaScript adds the brain of the website/webpage : thus giving the website/webpage its functionality.
- JavaScript or popularly known as JS, is a high level dynamic interpreted programming language.

How The Web Works
*****************
Browser sends a request to the webserver hosting the website that the user or client wants to visit. 
The web server has its own IP address & stores all the files related to the webpage. The Server Backend can be 
written in PHP, Python, or Node.js. The web server sends a response to the client in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
files of the requested webpage.
